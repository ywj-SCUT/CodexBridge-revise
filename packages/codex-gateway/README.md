# @codexbridge/codex-gateway

Internal package for the Codex Gateway protocol layer.

## Status

Development for this package is currently paused. New integrations should use
`@codexbridge/codex-provider-relay`, which now owns the reusable provider
profile surface, protocol converters, capability policy, and local Responses
adapter server.

It remains in the repository as historical/internal reference material, but it
is not part of the active roadmap at this time.

Current release policy:

- keep this package `private: true`
- keep the export surface minimal while the API boundary stabilizes
- keep package-local build output in `packages/codex-gateway/dist` so `package.json` export paths describe real artifacts
- only revisit npm publication after live-provider coverage and CodexBridge integration contracts are stable

## Internal standalone server

This package now includes an internal-only launcher for the local Responses
adapter server. The primary routes are `GET /models`, `POST /responses`, and
`POST /responses/compact`; `/v1/*` aliases remain available for OpenAI SDK
compatibility. Build the package, then run:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/codex-gateway run serve
```

or:

```bash
node packages/codex-gateway/dist/cli.js
```

You can also load a dotenv-style file:

```bash
node packages/codex-gateway/dist/cli.js --env-file /path/to/codex-gateway.env
```

or:

```bash
CODEX_GATEWAY_ENV_FILE=/path/to/codex-gateway.env \
node packages/codex-gateway/dist/cli.js
```

For package-local protocol tracing, enable:

```bash
node packages/codex-gateway/dist/cli.js --trace
```

or:

```bash
CODEX_GATEWAY_TRACE=1 \
node packages/codex-gateway/dist/cli.js
```

This emits structured trace events to `stderr` as NDJSON without depending on
CodexBridge runtime logging.

Supported env knobs:

- `CODEX_GATEWAY_ENV_FILE`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_TRACE`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_CAPABILITY_PRESET`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_MODEL`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_HOST`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_PORT`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_PROVIDER_NAME`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_PROVIDER_KIND`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_OWNED_BY`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_CHAT_PATH`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_CAPABILITY_OVERRIDES_JSON`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_MODEL_CATALOG_JSON`
- `CODEX_GATEWAY_MODEL_CATALOG_PATH`

Preset-native envs such as `OPENROUTER_*`, `DEEPSEEK_*`, `MINIMAX_*`, `QWEN_*`,
and the Qwen/DashScope aliases are also accepted as fallbacks for API key/base
URL/model resolution.

Immutable target:

> `@codexbridge/codex-gateway` lets Codex run on non-OpenAI and
> OpenAI-compatible model providers by translating Codex-native Responses API
> traffic into provider-specific APIs.

This package owns only protocol behavior:

- Responses request conversion
- Chat Completions response conversion
- SSE and stream event conversion
- tool/function call conversion
- usage and error normalization
- multimodal and reasoning/thinking payload policy
- provider capability and payload rules
- a local Responses adapter server with `/responses` and `/v1/responses`
  compatibility routes

The package `/models` and `/v1/models` output now preserves raw catalog
metadata such as `contextWindow`, `pricing`, and model `capabilities`, and
also exposes a normalized top-level `meta` block plus a per-model `protocol`
block for effective adapter behavior such as tools, web search, multimodal
input, reasoning support, reasoning transport mode, upstream model alias
routing, compact support, structured output, and output-token limits.

The adapter server also supports an optional package-local trace sink so
request translation, response translation, retry behavior, and translated
stream events can be debugged without reproducing issues through WeChat or
CodexBridge runtime logs. Trace output also includes machine-readable
`request.adjusted` events when compatibility rules filter fields, drop
unsupported tools, cap output-token requests, or downgrade unsupported
image/file input.

It must not own bridge behavior:

- WeChat or Telegram transports
- slash commands or i18n
- SendGate or platform rate limits
- bridge sessions, thread binding, approval, retry, or reconnect state
- assistant records, automations, uploads, or artifact delivery policy

Phase 1B moved the provider capability catalog, CLIProxyAPI-style model catalog,
and reasoning/thinking policy into this package. Phase 1C moved the pure
Responses/Chat converter and SSE translator implementation into this package.
Phase 3 moved the local Responses adapter server into this package, with
Responses-first root routes and `/v1/*` compatibility aliases. The old
CodexBridge paths still exist as re-export shims during migration:

- `src/providers/openai_compatible/capability_presets.ts`
- `src/providers/openai_compatible/cliproxy_model_catalog.ts`
- `src/providers/openai_compatible/responses_adapter.ts`
- `src/providers/openai_compatible/responses_adapter_server.ts`
- `src/providers/shared/thinking_policy.ts`

CodexBridge now keeps only the OpenAI-compatible provider integration wrapper in
`src/providers/openai_compatible/plugin.ts`; package code still must not import
from CodexBridge core/platform/runtime/store/i18n.

## Validation

Package-level checks:

```bash
pnpm run codex-gateway:check-boundary
pnpm run codex-gateway:typecheck
pnpm run codex-gateway:test
pnpm run codex-gateway:build
```

Live OpenAI-compatible provider smoke tests are gated and must run through the
CodexBridge provider profile loader:

```bash
pnpm run test:live-openai-compatible
CODEXBRIDGE_TEST_ENV_FILE=/path/to/codexbridge.env pnpm run test:live-openai-compatible
```

The live test runner does not print API key values. It skips providers whose
profile env is missing, and verifies available provider profiles through the
local Responses adapter server.
