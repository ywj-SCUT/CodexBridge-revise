# Weixin Slash Commands

This document describes the current text-first slash command surface for the WeChat bridge.

## Locale

Slash-command replies now go through the shared i18n layer.

- Supported locales:
  - `zh-CN`
  - `en`
- Command-level precedence: `/lang` value overrides scope override and environment default for that scope/session.
- Default locale: `zh-CN`
- Override with:
  - `CODEXBRIDGE_LOCALE=zh-CN`
  - `CODEXBRIDGE_LOCALE=en`

Example:

```bash
CODEXBRIDGE_LOCALE=en npm run weixin:serve
```

## Design Rule

The WeChat bridge is not a strict shell CLI.
It borrows the most useful CLI help conventions while staying chat-friendly:

- `/helps` shows the full command catalog
- `/helps <command>` shows one command in detail
- every slash command supports `-h`, `--help`, `-help`, and `-helps`
- every slash command also supports a short alias such as `/h`, `/st`, `/us`, `/lg`, `/sp`, `/rv`, `/sk`, `/n`, `/up`, `/as`, `/td`, `/rmd`, `/nt`, `/pd`, `/ms`, `/m`, `/psn`, `/ins`, `/th`, `/se`, `/nx`, `/pv`, `/o`, `/pk`, `/rn`, `/perm`, `/al`, `/dn`, `/rc`, `/rt`, and `/rs`
- `/lang` and `/lang <zh|en>` to switch reply language for this scope (higher priority than env).
- thread browsing is index-first on WeChat, so `/open 2` is preferred over copying raw thread ids
- before the bot reaches roughly 10 consecutive replies, the user can proactively send a single `/` to break the WeChat-side frequency limit; it is swallowed by the bridge, not forwarded to Codex, and does not create a reply

## Command Catalog

### `/helps`, `/help`, and `/h`

Show all slash commands, or show help for one command.

Examples:

```text
/helps
/helps threads
/help open
/h
```

### Local keepalive pulse: `/`

Use a single `/` proactively before the bot reaches roughly 10 consecutive replies, so you can break the WeChat-side frequency limit before normal commands continue.

- it is treated as a local keepalive pulse by the bridge
- it is not forwarded to Codex
- it does not create a new reply, task, or record
- its purpose is to let the user proactively break the WeChat-side consecutive bot-message throttle
- only a bare single `/` counts as this pulse; commands like `/retry` keep their normal command meaning

Example:

```text
/
```

### `/status`, `/where`, and `/st`

Show the current scope binding, provider profile, Codex thread, access settings, and active-turn state.

Examples:

```text
/status
/where
/st
```

### `/login` and `/lg`

Manage the host Codex login account pool.

- `/login` starts or refreshes a pending device login flow
- `/login list` shows the locally saved account pool
- `/login <index>` switches the active host Codex login
- `/login cancel` cancels the pending device login flow

Examples:

```text
/login
/lg
/login list
/login 1
/login cancel
```

### `/stop` and `/sp`

Request an interrupt for the active Codex turn.
`/stop` is the canonical command shown to WeChat users.

Examples:

```text
/stop
/sp
```

### `/review` and `/rv`

Run a native Codex code review for the current workspace changes.

- `/review` reviews uncommitted changes
- `/review base <branch>` reviews the diff against a base branch
- `/review commit <sha>` reviews the changes introduced by a commit
- `/review custom <instructions>` runs a prompt-driven focused review
- `/review <natural language>` lets Codex route the request to uncommitted, base, commit, or custom review
- the final review text tries to follow the current `/lang` setting
- the bridge returns the native text review result directly to WeChat
- it does not switch the current thread binding

Examples:

```text
/review
/rv
/review base main
/review commit HEAD~1
/review custom 只审查测试目录里的改动
/review 重点看 Agent 状态流转相关改动的回归风险
```

### `/as`, `/log`, `/todo`, `/remind`, and `/note`

Save personal assistant records from WeChat.

- `/as <text>` is the unified natural-language entry for this whole assistant-record group. Codex first decides whether the text should create a new record or manage an existing one. New records are routed to `log`, `todo`, `reminder`, or `note`; existing-record requests are routed to the matching record type and action such as update, complete, cancel, or archive.
- `/log <text>` forces a log record.
- `/todo <text>` forces a todo record. Use `/todo done 1` to complete it.
- `/remind <text>` forces a reminder. Phrases such as `明天上午10点` and `每周一早上9点` are parsed locally.
- `/note <text>` forces a note record.
- Logs and notes are saved directly. `/as` todo/reminder drafts ask for confirmation with `/as ok`.
- `/as edit <change instruction>` refines the pending draft by merging the new instruction back into the original matched record.
- `/as <natural update>` can also update existing records. The bridge asks Codex to route the message as create, update, complete, cancel, or archive. It only targets an existing record when the message clearly refers to the same concrete item; otherwise it creates a new record. Existing-record changes ask Codex to merge the original record with the new instruction and require `/as ok` before writing.
- `/as search <keyword>` searches records in the current WeChat chat.
- `/as show 1` shows full content and attachment paths.
- `/as del 1` archives a record.

Examples:

```text
/as 今天修复了 /pg search 日记召回太宽的问题 #CodexBridge
/as 明天上午10点提醒我给王总回电话
/as ok
/as edit 把王总改成李总，时间改成明天上午11点
/as cancel
/as 给王总回电话这件事已经完成了

/as 修马桶发票已经拿回来了
/as edit 备注：还差医药发票不确定
/as ok
/log 今天测试微信桥接，发现插件搜索需要更高相关度
/todo 下周五前整理 CodexBridge 视频脚本 p1
/todo done 1
/remind 每周一早上9点提醒我看项目进度
/note Notion 适合结构化日志，Google Drive 适合导出归档
```

Attachment workflow:

```text
/up
发送一个或多个文件、图片、语音、视频
/as 把这些资料记录为合同附件 #合同
```

When `/up` is active, finishing with `/as`, `/log`, `/todo`, `/remind`, or `/note` archives the staged files into the assistant attachment directory instead of sending the batch to Codex as a normal thread prompt.

Data layout:

```text
~/.codexbridge/runtime/assistant_records.json
~/.codexbridge/assistant/attachments/YYYY/MM/DD/<recordId>/
```

Boundary with `/auto`:

- `/remind` only notifies you at a time.
- `/todo` tracks work you will do.
- `/auto` runs scheduled system work and sends the result back to WeChat.

### `/plan` and `/pl`

Inspect or toggle the current bridge session plan mode.

- `/plan` shows the current mode
- `/plan on` enables native `plan` mode for later turns in the current session
- `/plan off` restores native `default` mode

Examples:

```text
/plan
/pl
/plan on
/plan off
```

Notes:

- this is a session-level collaboration mode toggle, not an approval flow
- when enabled, later normal messages start in native `plan` mode
- when disabled, later normal messages return to native `default` mode

### `/experimental`, `/experiment`, `/experiments`, and `/exp`

Inspect or change the official global Codex feature flags.

- `/experimental` shows the current global experimental feature state
- `/experimental list` lists visible feature flags from `codex features list`
- `/experimental show <index|featureName>` shows one feature in detail
- `/experimental on <index|featureName>` globally enables one feature
- `/experimental off <index|featureName>` globally disables one feature
- when `goals` is enabled, `/goal` becomes available as an additional slash command

Examples:

```text
/experimental
/exp list
/experimental show memories
/experimental on memories
/experimental off prevent_idle_sleep
```

Notes:

- this command follows the official Codex CLI semantics: it changes the global Codex feature config, not just the current session
- new sessions inherit the new setting automatically
- CodexBridge resets local Codex clients after a change, so the next reply uses the new configuration
- removed and deprecated features are hidden by default

### `/goal`

Only available when `/experimental on goals` has been enabled.

- `/goal` shows the native goal on the current bound Codex thread
- `/goal <text>` sets the native thread goal directly
- `/goal pause` pauses the thread goal without clearing it
- `/goal resume` resumes a paused thread goal
- `/goal clear` removes the thread goal

Examples:

```text
/goal
/goal 持续把 CodexBridge 的微信体验打磨到更稳定
/goal pause
/goal resume
/goal clear
```

Notes:

- `/goal` now talks to the native Codex thread goal RPC instead of injecting bridge-only goal text
- it operates on the current bound persistent Codex thread, so run `/new` or send a normal message first if no thread is bound yet
- updating the goal state is immediate, but a turn that is already running may still finish its current tail work

### `/skills` and `/sk`

Use `/skills` as the management and inspection surface for skills visible to Codex under the active session cwd. The normal way to use a skill is still to tell Codex in natural language which skill to use for which task.

- `/skills` shows the current visible skills
- `/skills search <keyword>` performs a broad relevance match over the visible skills
- `/skills show <index|name>` explains a skill's purpose, path, scope, default prompt, and dependencies
- `/skills on <index|name>` enables the selected skill
- `/skills off <index|name>` disables the selected skill
- `/skills reload` forces a fresh re-scan for the current cwd
- for actual work, directly say things like `use assistant-checkin skill to review my records` in natural language; `/skills` itself is mainly for browsing and management

Examples:

```text
/skills
/sk
/skills search 新闻
/skills show 1
/skills on 2
/skills off 2
/skills reload
```

### `/plugins` and `/pg`

Browse and manage native Codex plugin packages. Search uses a local hybrid matcher: exact/fuzzy text matching over plugin metadata plus bilingual synonym expansion for common needs such as todo, diary, mail, calendar, repository, MCP, and skills. It only shows high-relevance matches, so broad words like logs or notes do not flood unrelated plugin results.

- `/plugins` or `/pg` shows featured plugins
- `/pg search <keyword>` searches plugin names, descriptions, capabilities, bundled Apps, MCP servers, and Skills
- `/pg search <keyword> <page>` opens another search result page
- `/pg list` groups plugins by capability type
- `/pg show <index|name>` explains what the selected plugin provides
- `/pg add <index|name>` installs a plugin package
- `/pg del <index|name>` uninstalls a plugin package
- `/pg alias <index|name> <alias>` sets a short alias for later `/use` or `@alias` calls

Examples:

```text
/plugins
/pg
/pg search 日记
/pg search todo
/pg search gogle drve
/pg search 邮箱 2
/pg list
/pg list 1
/pg show 1
/pg add 1
/pg alias 1 gd
```

### `/automation` and `/auto`

Create and manage scheduled background jobs. Results are always delivered back to the same WeChat chat.

- `/auto <text>` is a natural-language routing entry for this automation group:
  - Codex decides whether the request is creating, editing, deleting, or otherwise managing an automation job
  - matching changes still go through a confirmation draft first
- `/auto add <text>` forces create-draft mode from natural language
- `/auto edit <text>` refines the current pending draft from natural language
- Codex can turn natural language into one or more schedule drafts
- `/auto confirm` persists the job or jobs
- default mode is `standalone`
- `thread` mode reuses the current bound session and requires an existing scope session
- `daily` and `cron` schedules are interpreted in `UTC`

Examples:

```text
/auto
/auto add 每30分钟检查一次系统状态，有变化发送给我
/auto add 每天早上7点调用 news skill 给我发送到微信
/auto add 工作日晚上6点检查部署状态，异常时通知我
/auto add 每天早上8点、中午13点、下午17点半，把待办事项整理后发到微信
/auto confirm
/auto edit 只把时间改成每小时，任务内容不变
/auto cancel
/auto list
/auto show 1
/auto pause 1
/auto resume 1
/auto rename 1 晚间部署巡检
/auto delete 1
/auto del 1
```

### `/new` and `/n`

Create a new bridge session on the current provider profile.
You can optionally pass a working directory.

Examples:

```text
/new
/new /home/ubuntu/dev/CodexBridge
/n
```

### `/provider` and `/pd`

List provider profiles or switch the current scope to another provider profile.

Examples:

```text
/provider
/pd
/provider openai-default
/pd openai-default
/provider DeepSeek
/pd deepseek
/provider minimax
/pd minimax
```

Notes:

- `openai-default` remains the user-facing Codex provider choice.
- When bridge-local Codex Native API is enabled, eligible internal helper tasks
  under `/pd openai-default` may run through the localhost native API
  automatically to avoid polluting the main thread.
- This does **not** introduce a separate user-facing `/provider` choice for the
  localhost native API.

DeepSeek, MiniMax, Qwen, OpenRouter, Kimi, Gemini, iFlow, and custom compatible APIs all use the same generic `openai-compatible` provider path. Adding one should normally be env configuration plus a capability preset, not a new provider plugin.

The OpenAI-compatible adapter follows the CLIProxyAPI-style split:

- provider selection is env/profile configuration
- model differences live in a capability catalog
- thinking/reasoning quirks are translated by model capability, not by a dedicated provider class
- payload quirks use CLIProxyAPI-style rules, including raw JSON values, root paths, protocol/model matching, overrides, defaults, and filters
- stream errors and Gemini-family `usageMetadata` are normalized back into Responses-shaped failures and usage
- `*_MODEL_CATALOG_PATH` can import either a normal array catalog or a CLIProxyAPI `models.json` object and merge token/thinking metadata into runtime capabilities
- transient retry is explicit env configuration, for example `MINIMAX_REQUEST_RETRY=2`, `MINIMAX_RETRY_STATUSES=429,503`, or `CODEX_COMPAT_REQUEST_RETRY=2`
- unavoidable local translator repairs, such as Kimi model alias rewrite and iFlow boolean thinking flags, stay inside the generic adapter layer

### `/models` and `/ms`

List available models for the current provider profile.

- shows the current effective model before the list
- marks the current effective model directly in the list
- keeps provider-default markers where the provider exposes them

Examples:

```text
/models
/ms
```

### `/model` and `/m`

View the current effective model configuration or switch it for the current scope.

- `/model` shows the current provider, effective model, model source, effective reasoning effort, effort source, and supported effort range
- `/model <effort>` updates only the reasoning effort for the current effective model
- `/model <index>` updates the model by the numbered list shown by `/models`
- `/model <modelId>` updates the model for future turns
- `/model <index|modelId> <effort>` updates both together
- `/model default` resets model and reasoning effort back to provider defaults for the session
- changes are session-scoped and take effect on the next turn

Examples:

```text
/model
/m
/model default
/model high
/model 1
/model 1 xhigh
/model gpt-5.4 xhigh
/model gpt-5.4
```

### `/personality [friendly|pragmatic|none]` and `/psn [friendly|pragmatic|none]`

Show or update the personality used for future turns in the current scope.

Examples:

```text
/personality
/psn
/personality pragmatic
/psn none
```

### `/instructions` and `/ins`

View or edit the global Codex custom instructions file backed by `AGENTS.md`.

- `/instructions` shows the current file path, content status, and any pending draft
- `/instructions <natural language>` asks Codex to draft an `AGENTS.md` change from natural language
- `/instructions set <text>` stages a full replacement draft inline
- `/instructions edit` arms the next non-command message as the full replacement draft content
- `/instructions edit <change request>` asks Codex to revise the current pending draft
- `/instructions clear` stages a clear draft instead of removing content immediately
- `/instructions ok` confirms the pending draft, writes `AGENTS.md`, and refreshes Codex sessions
- `/instructions cancel` discards the pending draft or exits pending edit-capture mode

Examples:

```text
/instructions
/ins
/instructions 以后回答更简短一点，并默认用中文回复微信文本消息。
/instructions set Always explain the tradeoffs before editing.
/instructions edit
/instructions edit 把附件规则删掉，但保留工程规范。
/instructions clear
/instructions ok
/instructions cancel
```

### `/fast`

Enable or disable Fast mode for future turns in the current scope.
`/fast` turns on `serviceTier=fast`. `/fast off` forces `serviceTier=flex`.

Examples:

```text
/fast
/fast off
```

### `/threads` and `/th`

Show the first page of threads for the current provider profile.
Each page is rendered as WeChat-friendly text with:

- page number
- current binding marker
- title or alias
- one-line preview
- relative update time
- suggested follow-up commands

`/threads del|restore|pin|unpin` supports two modes:

- explicit indexes or thread ids for deterministic local execution
- natural language for AI-selected batch targets, which always returns a pending draft first and then requires `/threads confirm`

`/threads <natural language>` can also route to the rest of the thread command group, including:

- open a thread
- preview a thread
- rename a thread
- switch between default / all / pinned views
- search or batch-manage related threads

Examples:

```text
/threads
/threads 打开昨天那个发票线程
/threads 先看一下 DailyWork 周报那个线程
/threads 把那个线程改名为微信桥接排障
/threads del 2 3
/threads del 把旧版登录排障线程归档
/threads pin DailyWork 相关线程
/threads confirm
/threads cancel
/threads -h
/th
```

### `/search <text>` and `/se <text>`

Search for relevant threads in natural language.
Bridge sends the current provider thread directory to Codex for semantic selection, then returns a WeChat-friendly candidate list.

Examples:

```text
/search bridge
/search 找昨天那个发票线程
/se bridge
/search 微信
/se 微信
```

### `/next`, `/prev`, `/nx`, and `/pv`

Move through the current thread browser page set.
You must run `/threads` or `/search` first so the current page context exists.

Examples:

```text
/threads
/next
/nx
/prev
/pv
```

### `/open <index|threadId>` and `/o <index|threadId>`

Bind the current WeChat scope to an existing Codex thread.
On WeChat, numeric indexes are the preferred way to open a thread.
After rebinding, CodexBridge also returns a short recent-turn preview from that thread,
so in many cases you can reopen a thread directly without calling `/peek` first.

Examples:

```text
/open 2
/o 2
/open 019d95ad-7166-7ee3-89a3-3bbb50e0fd64
```

### `/peek <index|threadId>` and `/pk <index|threadId>`

Preview the most recent turns from a thread before opening it.

Examples:

```text
/peek 1
/pk 1
/peek 019d95ad-7166-7ee3-89a3-3bbb50e0fd64
```

### `/rename <index|threadId> <alias>` and `/rn <index|threadId> <alias>`

Set a local bridge alias for a thread.
This does not change the provider-side thread id.

Examples:

```text
/rename 2 微信桥接排障
/rn 2 微信桥接排障
/rename 019d95ad-7166-7ee3-89a3-3bbb50e0fd64 CodexBridge
```

### `/permissions [preset]` and `/perm [preset]`

Show or update the access preset for the next turn.

Supported presets:

- `read-only`
- `default`
- `full-access`

Examples:

```text
/permissions
/perm
/permissions full-access
/perm full-access
```

### `/allow [1|2] [index]` and `/al [1|2] [index]`

Handle the approval request that is currently pending during an active turn.
This mirrors the Codex CLI/App-style `1 / 2 / 3` approval flow on WeChat.

- `/allow` shows the current pending approval list
- `/allow 1` approves the first pending request once
- `/allow 2` approves and remembers it for the current session when supported
- if multiple requests are pending, use `/allow 2 2` to answer request `#2`

Examples:

```text
/allow
/al
/allow 1
/allow 2
/allow 2 2
```

Notes:

- use `/permissions` to change the default preset for the next turn
- use `/allow` only for the approval request that is pending right now
- `/allow 2` is session-scoped remembered approval, not a replacement for `/permissions full-access`

### `/deny [index]` and `/dn [index]`

Deny the approval request that is currently pending during an active turn.
This is the clearer replacement for the old `/allow 3` wording.

- `/deny` denies the first pending request
- `/deny 2` denies request `#2` when multiple approvals are pending
- old `/allow 3` remains supported for compatibility, but it is no longer the recommended form

Examples:

```text
/deny
/dn
/deny 2
```

### `/reconnect` and `/rc`

Refresh the current Codex provider session.

Example:

```text
/reconnect
/rc
```

### `/retry` and `/rt`

Retry the previous non-command user request in the same thread.
The bridge refreshes the current Codex session first, then starts a new turn with the previous request snapshot.

- use this after a turn becomes `interrupted`
- this does not resume the old turn in place; it reruns the previous request as a new turn
- if the previous request depended on local attachments that no longer exist, the bridge will refuse the retry and show the missing path

Examples:

```text
/retry
/rt
```

### `/restart` and `/rs`

Queue a restart of the bridge service when the current host supports it.

Example:

```text
/restart
/rs
```

### `/lang`

View or switch the current scope's language.

Examples:

```text
/lang
/lang zh-CN
/lang en
/lang zh
```

### `⭐️ /`

Send a single `/` proactively before the bot reaches roughly 10 consecutive outbound WeChat messages.

- it is treated as a local keepalive pulse by the bridge
- it is not forwarded to Codex
- it does not trigger any reply
- use it to break the current WeChat-side risk-control streak before you stop receiving later Codex messages

## Help Conventions

Each command supports the same help entrypoints.

Examples:

```text
/threads -h
/open --help
/rename -helps
/th -h
/perm --help
```

These forms are equivalent to:

```text
/helps threads
/helps open
/helps rename
```

## Recommended WeChat Workflow

For day-to-day use on WeChat:

1. Run `/threads`
2. Use `/peek 1` or `/peek 2` to inspect candidates
3. Use `/open 1` or `/open 2` to bind the thread
4. Use `/rename 1 <alias>` if you want a stable, readable name
5. Use `/stop` if the current reply needs to be interrupted
6. Use `/permissions` when you need to inspect or change the next-turn access preset
7. Use `/personality` to keep the session tone aligned with how you want Codex to respond
8. Use `/instructions` when you want to draft, confirm, or revise your global custom instructions without leaving WeChat
9. Use `/allow` to approve and `/deny` to reject when Codex asks for approval during the current turn
10. Use `/retry` after an interrupted turn; use `/reconnect` only when you want to refresh the session without rerunning the previous request

This workflow avoids copying raw thread ids and works well in a chat UI without buttons.
